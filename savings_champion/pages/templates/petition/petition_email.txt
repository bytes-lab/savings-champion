Hi {{ first_name }}, thanks for signing our petition!

Even though we've only just launched our campaign, we have already written to George Osborne, Chancellor of the Exchequer.

We hope he will use this golden opportunity for savers, at no cost to the government in his 2014 budget statement. We have attached our letter to this email.

It's a good start but just the very beginning and we need your help.

The bigger the petition, the bigger the message we send that savers deserve better from banks and building societies.

Can you forward the email below to your friends now and ask them to add their names to the petition?

Can you also spread the word on Facebook and Twitter, if you use them? You can tell your friends about the petition easily by clicking the quick links below:

Hi,

Have a look at this:
https://www.savingschampion.co.uk/switch-my-savings-petition-campaign/

Savers need help! With record low interest rates savers have suffered for long enough and providers are profiting from your inertia.

I've signed a petition telling George Osborne to help make it easier to switch savings accounts, which will increase competition and in turn improve rates, without costing the government a penny.

If enough of us get involved we can empower change.

Please sign the petition here:
